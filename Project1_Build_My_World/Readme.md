# Project 1 - Build My World

In this project, I created a Gazebo simulation of an office environment that goes by the name MyOfficeWorld.world. I also built a Gazebo model of a customized differential drive robot and equipped it with Gazebo plugins, for instance, hokuyo laser scanner and a RGB camera sensor. The project also teaches the student to insert plugins, which are nothing but C++ code snippets that interact with the Gazebo world file. This Gazebo world and the robot model was used for all subsequent projects.
